An audio aura is determined by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability

Energey Ave. 0.659
Valence Ave. 0.484
Danceability Ave. 0.716

If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
->Because the valence average shows low value while other two energy and danceability average shows a bit higher value than valence one,
they may seek to musics that make them happier in general.

Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
->The data that comes from only top 100 songs may lack of creditability to substantiate the representation of all og the users.
Thus, we simply need to include more data in the table.
