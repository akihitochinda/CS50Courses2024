This is CS50 web assignment for project 1 "wiki" and I will demonstrate its functions one by one according to the specifications, opening my wiki page with python run server.

And this is the top page for Wikipedia-like encyclopedia which has index for listing the names of all pages as requested.
And can be taken directly to that entry page with the URL wiki/title of the page as first spec requires.
If I put something that is not on the list, it displays that page was not found.

On the search encyclopedia, I have the functions to search the words, which I can search a specific word in the list and be taken to the search results.
If the query does not match the name of the encyclopedia entry, then it displays a list of all entries that have the query as a substring. Then I can go to that entry.

On the create new page function, I have the area to enter a title, and the markdown content for the page,
If an encyclopedia entry already exists with the provided title, then I will be presented with an error message.
Otherwise, the entry is saved on the list, then can access to the new entry's page with Markdown to HTML conversion.
And here is the edit button, which is pre-populated with the existing contents, and can modify it and save.
Then I will be redirected back to the entry's page,

And finally, I have the random page which takes me to a random encyclopedia entry.


And that's all for my demonstration. Thank you for your review.
