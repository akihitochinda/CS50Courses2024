This is CS50 web assignment for project 0 "search" and I will demonstrate its functions one by one according to the specifications, opening my index.html with live server.

And this is the top page for google search which is aesthetically similar with real google page as requested.
As first spec requires, it has three pages respectively, regular search, image search, and advanced search.

On the google search page, I have the functions similar with real one, centered and rounded corners search bar, and search button underneath the bar, which I can search and be taken to the google search results.

Similarly, on the google image search page, I am able to type and search with image search results as shown here.

And finally, I have the advanced search page which I have four types of field vertically and left aligned.
Then I will put these test words for example, and if I left blank "none of these words" section, I see the top result is "edX", at the same time, if I put "python" in the last section, I see different results here.

For the "I'm feeling lucky" button, I encounter a redirect notice that is an expected results, then if I redirect I see one of the online encyclopedia page, not Wikipedia page at this time.

And that's all for my demonstration. Thank you for your review.
